  <h1><b>Concrete in the Roman Empire</b></h1>
<p>CLAS 4091 Final Project - Zachary Chan</p>
<h2> Rome and Concrete </h2>
<p class="paragraph"> During the Age of Augustus we saw many innovations in Roman society that helped bring Rome and its fame to what it is today. Specifically the architectural overhaul that took place during Augustus reign was very prominent in promoting Romes wealth as well as stature. One innovation that really changed the architecture and efficiency of building in Rome, was the creation of concrete. For some backstory we are going to start at the late 3rd centuries BC, it was first observed that limestone walls with rock debris were used between each stone that was created in Pompey. This ussage of concrete was quite significant throughout the construction of Romes empire as it allowed the creation of larger and stronger structures, which were not even possible or fathomable before the creating of concrete. The roman term for this concrete was <i>Opus Caementicium</i> which was actually a term which was derived from the Latin word for rubble(caementa). One of the main reasons why I wanted to research more into specifically the ussage of concrete throughout the Roman Empire is due to the innovative aspect of it, as it was a extremely new technology that they had at their disposal as well as being responsible for the construction of some of Romes greatest structual monuments!

<p class="paragraph">
Early concrete was actually not infact developed by the Romans but rather it was an adaptation of different mortars that were being used already in earlier construction. This Mortar at the start really was just a mix of materials which were mixed into a semi fluid state. Naturally due to the Romans location and geography, they had access to volcanic rock which was very common within the region of Italy. Deposits of this unconsolidated volcanic rock were in surplus within Romes environment, inlcuding ash, lapilli of pumice, and scoriaThis volcanic rock could easily be broken down into a sediment which was then used as a basis for Roman concrete. After this by the late 3rd century BC, the Romans had improved the mixture of their mortar to contain lime and clay, allowing a bit more fluidity and application. With the combination of aggregates(filling elements), the Romans gained the ability to create very strong and rigid walls. More specifically volcanic ash has soluble silica which in turn reacts with the lime when water is then added to the mixture. As a result of this, cement gel characteristics are created by the crystalline matrix which is produced (calcium aluminum silicate hydrate combined with A1-toberorite), giving off a chemical reaction. Moreover for different purposes, like foundation vs. using it for walls, different mixtures were used, varying the rocks used. Some of these differences were the rock materials that were used within the mixture. For stronger base foundational ussage, heavier rock materials were used, which I would assume was the case as the heavier rocks allowed a stronger more structurally sound construction naturally. Then for lighter concrete mixtures, like high vaulting (Shown in the image below), which was another word for constructing building arches, they used mighter rock materials like Pumice. Pumice which was a very light volcanic rock due to its porosity, which was naturally created when a gas-rich froth of glassy lava soliifies very rapidly. In addition a way to almost recycle, they would use the materials from fallen or destroyed structures and put that into the aggregate mixture as well which is quite interesting.

<p class="paragraph">
  As Romans scientifically advanced, so did their concrete. By the late 2nd Century BC, a new mortar came to light as the Romans came across volcanic ash located near Pozzuoli in Italy. The volcanic ash, utlized in their cement allows a whole different application of their concrete and functionality. This mortar, formally known as pozzolana, is a cement that is damp, which in turn allows water to be retained in the cement, creating a waterproofing ability to their buildings, as well as preventing corrosion and decay. Furthermore I think that this innovation and ussage of concrete throughout Roman architecture really is what helped create the longevity of Roman structures; inwhich some still remain in partial form today. In shaping the concrete into what the Romans invisioned, they needed some sort of framing device to help give the concrete the shape they were looking to create. This was done by simply using wooden frames, where the Romans would pour the concrete mixture into it, taking the shape of the wooden frame, and giving it the proper time to rest and harden up.
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
  One super interesting part about their usage of concrete is the rigitity they acheived when mixing the conrete. Moreover a researcher study led by Marie Jackson a professor of geology and geophysics at the University of Utah did a extensive study of the concrete using an electron microscope that brought to light a interesting distribution of minerals. This research showed that the concrete also infact contained percolation of seawater. The addition of the seawater which reacts with the lime and volcanic ash in turn actually allowed the minerals to interlock, and therefore tightening up the contents of the concrete, allowing the creation of a much stronger concrete than if there was no seawater which is super interesting in the fact that the Romans most likely had no idea of this reaction even taking place! In addition to creating much more rugid structures, the time efficiency of the construction of buildings drastically increased, as the labor and the physical moving of materals was much less tasking than cutting and then transporting cut stone and pillars. In addition to this there was a great convenience factor that came along with using concrete over solid cut stone as well. Instead of having a skilled sculpter tediously chipping away and shapping a solid cut stone, concrete on the otherhand was an extremely easy to learn skill. With the ussage of concrete, the majority of the workers did not need to have exemplary skills or education. Instead with concrete, there would be generally a highly skilled and educated worker who would be overseeing the projects. Examples of these highly skilled workers would be titled an architect, master mason or even master carpenter. However, those who would actually be doing the labor of mixing and pouring the concrete were more commonly than not unskilled labourers. These labourers were commonly tasked with the carrying, mixing, and pouring of the concrete. One major differentiating factor between cut stone construction vs. concrete however was the timeline of the construction. With the cut stone method, it would depend on how fast the worker could chip and sculpt the structure. On the otherhand with the concrete method, it was much more dependant on the concrete itself, as they would have to wait for the concrete to dry and solidify, which is definately worth noting. Having this overall much more efficient way of construction was definately big contributing factor to the efficiency and ultimately amazing buildings the Romans produced, which is why I think concrete is super interesting to look into.

<h3>
  The Pantheon
</h3>

<p class="paragraph">
  The Pantheon is one of the most famous and impressive structures that was built during the Roman empire which is still to this day is extremely well preserved, and there is good reason behind it. The Pantheon was built during Hadrian's emperorship, and one of the main factors in why the Pantheon is still extremely well preserved to this day is the ussage of concrete, specifically its dome construction. Hadrian designed the Pantheon and structure is a great example of Hadrians advancement within the vaulted system which I mentioned above. Its construction was started somewhere between the years 118 to 119 AD which was then completed between 125 and 128 AD. Throughout its time it has stood strong through fires, earthquakes, and even bombings, which is quite impressive for how long ago it was constructed, as well as sitting 142 feet above ground level. The Pantheons dome is even moreso impresive as the dome is not even reinforced with addition material, simply just being constructed of concrete. There is no iron rods or anything to help keep its shape which is just a fun fact about it! The foundation of the Pantheon was of course constructed by the ussage of a concrete, where almost 90% of the intermediate block and rotunda is made from concrete. In terms of weight, the concrete used for the Pantheon dome itself was about 5,000 metric tons.

<p class="paragraph">
  In terms of the actual construction proces of the Pantheon, as most concrete structures must be built, it was built in the process of levels, starting from the bottom to the top. These levels varried in strength depending on the aggregate that was used. More specifically the Pantheon was built with a 5 layer system. With how gravity works, the lowest levels of the structure contained the densest and the most cohesive aggregates, giving the structure its rigidity and a very solid base. Naturally as the layers rose, the lighter the aggregate was as well. On the very top layer of the Pantheon, pumice is used, which was at the time the lightest aggregate possible. Going more indepth in the construction process of the Pantheon, for the foundations, the construction process consisted of designated carpenters building castings, in order to have set shapes for the concrete to be poured into. Next for the rotunda walls, the walls for the main room, where the dome sat above, they pourned dense concrete as well as aggregate mixture into short wide trenches, this once dried was layered ontop of the original foundation, essentially till it the start of the dome structure. The dome itself is really what makes the Pantheon extremely advanced for its time. Furthermore instead of one big mold for the dome, it was rather split into two half spheres molds constructed from wood. Wooden struts were used to help guide the mods to form the molds together. In order to create the domes intricate design on the interior side, they use the Romans attached castings of coffers to the wodden molds to help form the intricute design on the interior of the dome. For the exterior, they had used circular brick dams which were set in the shape of step-rings buttraces. Then step by step, they layed in the concrete till the top of the dome rounded out. With all of this said, I really do think the Pantheon was a crucial turning point in advancement and prestige of Roman Architecture at the time. Moreover concrete was a huge part of how the Romans expanded and developed their civilization, giving them the ability to create all sorts of new structures, while also decreasing the labor and time that was needed to build these structures.
